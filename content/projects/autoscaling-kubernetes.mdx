I deployed an Ingress controller to route the traffic and set up an autoscale policy so that the number of Ingress controller pods instantly expands and contracts to match traffic fluctuations. Now, your Ingress controller pods seamlessly handle the traffic surges - "Goodbye, latency!", and when traffic decreases the pods scale down to conserve resources - "Hello, cost savings!" - well done, you.
